# spring-boot-and-spark
Running Apache Spark with Spring Boot.

Apache Spark application running on top of Spring Boot. This example contains a word count calculation which can be called by a HTTP endpoint. Spark runs in local mode and the positive thing is that the Spark context is maintained and does not have to be restarted for each request. Ideal for online applications.
